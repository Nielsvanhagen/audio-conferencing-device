## About TinLab
The Tinlab Embedded Systems focuses on integrated electronic systems in consumer articles or devices. 
The essence of an embedded system is that software is embedded in a hardware device. 
During this Tinlab we will make an audio conferencing device, this system will be an addition to the current online meetings. 
This system, consisting two seperate devices, can exchange audio with a wireless connection. 
These devices can be used to make remote meetings or lectures more accessible since there are measurements taken like the 6 feet distance rule. 
The device is easy to set up and can be used for several hours.
